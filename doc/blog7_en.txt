        <h3>Background Introduction</h3>

        <p><strong>Could you briefly tell us about yourself and your current job?</strong></p>
        <p>I am Will Chia, but people call me Will. I recently started a consulting company called “Will You Minimize,” which focuses on guiding SMEs (Small and medium-sized enterprises) through the transition to sustainable development from financial, digital, and ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) aspects. Our slogan is “Will You Minimize Waste and Maximize Your Value,” which reflects the core of what we are doing here.</p>

        <p><strong>How many years since you started your own company?</strong></p>
        <p>Actually, I just started it this year. I had some ESG-related work experience before. One was when I was in charge of ESG projects at the Department of Budget Management, and the other was a job about impact investing at a family office.</p>

        <p><strong>What are the main areas of focus for your company?</strong></p>
        <p>Our job is centered around sustainable development. However, we are different from traditional ESG consulting firms. We don’t just help companies write <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="A global non-profit that helps companies, cities, and regions report their environmental impact. By promoting transparency and risk management, CDP encourages action toward a more sustainable economy.">CDP (Carbon Disclosure Project)</span> reports and <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="A global partnership that helps companies set science-based emissions reduction targets aligned with the Paris Agreement, aiming to limit global warming to 1.5°C and achieve net-zero by 2050.">SBTi (Science Based Targets Initiative)</span> surveys. We also focus on second-generation successors of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), especially those facing ESG challenges. Through the lenses of finance, ESG, and digital transformation, we help these businesses achieve a sustainable transition during their succession process.</p>
        <p>Currently, my client falls roughly into three categories:</p>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>The <strong>textile industry in Taiwan</strong></li>
                <li>The <strong>steel industry in Malaysia</strong></li>
                <li>The <strong>financial sector</strong> (We provide services like preparing reports and CDP surveys)</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p><strong> Which three key words best describe your role, and why?</strong></p>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Systemic reform</strong>：This comes from MIT’s systems thinking theory, and is used to solve complex issues.</li>
                <li><strong>Legacy</strong>：We focus on challenges faced by second-generation successors from SMEs and help them achieve the goal of sustainable operation.</li>
                <li><strong>Minimize</strong>：We try to minimize the unnecessary processes within SMEs to reduce waste and create greater value.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>Career</h3>

        <p><strong>Could you walk us through your career since you graduated?</strong></p>
        <p> My career has roughly four stages:：</p>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>AECOM</strong>：I was an environmental data analyst at this world-famous environmental engineering consulting firm.</li>
                <li><strong>Systemic Innovation & Mutual Flourishing Office (SIMFO)</strong>：Focusing on impact investing and promoting MIT Systems thinking and systems mapping.</li>
                <li><strong>E.SUN Financial Holding</strong>：articipating in the preparation of <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="A global framework for companies to disclose how climate-related risks and opportunities impact their business, helping investors make informed financial decisions.">TCFD (Task Force on Climate Related Financial Disclosures)</span> and <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="A global initiative that helps organizations assess and disclose their impacts and dependencies on nature, aiming to integrate nature-related risks and opportunities into financial and business decision-making.">TNFD (Task Force on Nature Related Financial Disclosures)</span> reports. At the same time, supporting E.SUN in building systems for managing <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="Greenhouse gas emissions that are attributed to financial institutions through their lending and investment activities.">Financed emissions</span>.</li>
                <li><strong>Enterpreneurship</strong>：I founded my own consulting company, focusing on helping SMEs go through transition and respond to sustainability-related challenges.</li>
            </ul>

        <p><strong>What made you decide to work in the sustainability sector?</strong></p>
        <p>My background began in civil engineering and landscape design. Later, I started to realize that <a>capital lies at the heart of transformation</a>, and that gradually led me toward finance-related work. From environmental data analysis to impact investing and eventually to sustainability projects in financial holding companies. All of these experiences brought me to where I am now—starting my own business.</p>
    
        <p><strong>Was there any differences between what you expected and what you saw for real?</strong></p>
        <p>Sustainability was mistaken as just CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility), but I think ESG takes it even further—it’s the process of “capitalizing external costs.” For example, a river would be seen as a public good, which usually is not properly managed. However, if we capitalize it and make it a resource belonging to the government or a corporation, it becomes possible to implement an effective management method, and, in turn, create greater value.</p>

        <p><strong>What has been the biggest challenge in your career, and how did you overcome it?</strong></p>
        <p>At SIMFO, we devoted large amounts of time to creating complicated systematic diagrams, yet it was too theoretical, making it hard for stakeholders to truly understand, let alone to take action. This experience made me realize that overly complex theories don’t translate well into real-world practice, and only simplified solutions can truly bring action.</p>

        <h3>Work Life</h3>

        <p><strong>Could you describe a typical day for you?</strong></p>
        <p>There are some differences between each job I’ve done. When I was at SIMFO, my work consisted of reading a huge number of reports, developing systems models, and communicating with the founder and the upper management. Later on during my time in E.SUN, I was mainly planning on TCFD and TNFD projects. I had to frequently communicate with both internal and external teams, while adapting international reporting frameworks to fit the local context.</p>
        <p>Currently, my daily work is pretty much about consulting, which basically is answering ESG-related questions raised by my clients, and providing suitable strategies for execution. For example, after signing on to the SBTi, I help clients choose the most suitable reporting framework—whether it's ESG or TCFD—tailored to the organization’s size and capabilities.</p>

        <p><strong>How’s your work-life balance?</strong></p>
        <p>Personally, I think it’s a transitioning process. During my past couple jobs, I had fixed working hours, but still I often deal with work during weekends. Now that I started my business, though my working hours have become more flexible, there’s also more pressure. So I’ll say there’s still room for improvement in terms of work-life balance.</p>

        <h3>Advice for young people</h3>

        <p><strong>What kind of qualities do you think are more suited for a career in sustainability? Are there any professional skills that are particularly important?</strong></p>
        <p>People who are good at data analysis often get to be involved in planning and decision-making. On the other hand, those without much experience with data might end up doing execution or marketing work. That’s why being able to work with data really gives you an edge.</p>

        <p><strong>According to your observation, what is the future trend in your particular field?</strong></p>
        <p>Right now, most people still think of ESG as an extension of CSR, but as the demand for global carbon reduction accelerates, the concept of capitalizing external costs will become more widespread. If resources like water and forest are not well managed, it will affect corporations' long-term competitiveness.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Lastly, what advice or encouragement do you have for young people who are looking to get into this field?</strong></p>
        <p>A sustainability career requires interest, professional skills, and contribution to society. Also, networking is a crucial step. By attending events or chatting with experts, you'll open up more opportunities and gain new insights. At the same time, looking for the right mentors or managers can really make a difference in your future career development.</p>
